I've added some wireframes, but the website that I used sort of cut them down to different resolutions. The basic idea is that a user goes from Homepage -> Register or Login. (subject to change after discussion)
When a user selects either of these buttons, the register or login fields expand in an accordion style and the respective button to advance appears. Users should only be able to see either the login or register fields, but not both at the same time.

Step by step: -Right click "Booking Site"
-Select "Build Paths"
-Select "Configure Build Paths"
-Select "Libraries"
-Select "Add JARs"
-Select sqlite-jdbc-3.16.1.jar (in the src folder of "Booking Site")
-Click "OK"
-Click "Apply"
Then you are all set, let me know if it doesn't work for you.
Mar 15 at 6:43 PM
Thomas Higgins on Add JARs to classpath (Instructions)
Generally means the program can't locate the resources on your machine. I would check that the classpath is present and updated for all the resources you need, likely for the .jar file that is included in the booking site file.
Alternatively you can call "Class.forName(org.sqlite.JDBC)" i believe
